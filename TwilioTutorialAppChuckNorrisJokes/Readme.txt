This is me going though an old tutorial of how to create a app that calls on a 
API that sends random Chuck Norris jokes from a WhatsApp phone number when you send 
messages to that number. I ended up using SMS instead, but the C# code should be the 
same. I did this for helping a teacher who planned to use those tutorials and who wanted 
me to give some feedback to what changes were needed to update it to how we write code 
today. (2022-11-10)

To use the tutorial in question you will need to set up a Twilio account unless you 
allready have one. The links below should take you to the tutorials I used when I created 
this slightly modiied code, bear in mind that they are a bit old and outdated. Azure 
does'nt look like it used to, for instance, nor does Visual Studio.
